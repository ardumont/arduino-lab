# arduino-lab

Mess around with arduino from the confort of the clojure repl.

Examples inspired from:
- https://github.com/nakkaya/clodiuno
- http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/

## Usage

My personal usage.
Could be an example on how to setup clodiuno as this was [kind of messy for me](http://adumont.fr/blog/my-first-steps-with-arduinoclodiuno).
This was worth it though :D
